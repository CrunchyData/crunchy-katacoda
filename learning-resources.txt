#Katacoda instructions for CrunchyData

The top level of our site has courses - courses are made up of scenarios - scenarios have a json file that defines the intro,
the instructional pages, the final page, the shell scripts to run when the scenario starts, which katacoda image to run, and
what the scenario layout will look like in terms of terminals and web pages.

## Here is how the site "works"
1. homepage-pathway.json controls what shows up on the home page on crunchydata.katacoda.com. It lists all the courses on our site
    * first item is the url of the course which is "https://crunchydata.katacoda.com/<name of the pathway minus the name pathway>"
        An example "external_link": "https://crunchydata.katacoda.com/workshops/" means there will be a workshops-pathway.json
        Inside that JSON file will be the layout for which scenarios will be in the course.
    * The title of the Course you want to show up to the end user
    * And then the action - which should be "Start Course" if you have content in the directory
2.

## Setting up a future workshop
1. Go to https:://dashboard.katacoda.com
2. Log in using the account and credentials that you used to log in to katacoda
3.

The list of available trainings comes from the pathways in the training directory. Whatever pathway you choose
will determine the home page that attendees will see when they sign in

If you want to test out new image builds (not content builds) before deploying to the production site you can go to
beta.katacoda.com/crunchydata

New VM image builds are automatically deployed there before they are manually moved to production katacoda. Please
remember is that you need to have content using image type before you can test it.
