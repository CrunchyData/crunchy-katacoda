And with that you have had a very brief introduction to the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator. There are many more features and advanced use cases you can carry out. For now, you can always go [read some more](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/4.2.2/quickstart/) about The Operator, looks at [common tasks](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/4.2.2/pgo-client/common-tasks/) to use with the Operator (which you can do right here in the scenario as added fun), or [command line](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/4.2.2/pgo-client/reference/) options for _pgo_. Thanks for attending and enjoy!
