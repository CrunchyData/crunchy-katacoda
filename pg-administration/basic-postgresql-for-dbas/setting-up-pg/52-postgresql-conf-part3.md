`hot_standby` - Setting for replicas to allow read-only queries to be able to be run on this system. Recent versions of PG default to `on`. https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-HOT-STANDBY

`wal_level` - Sets the level of data included in the Write Ahead Log (WAL) files. Valid values for this setting have changed over major PG versions. Now defaults to `replica` to immediately be able to allow the WAL stream to be used for replication. For systems with no replicas, can be set to `minimal` to reduce WAL traffic size. https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-WAL-LEVEL

`archive_mode` - Enables secondary archiving of WAL files by running `archive_command`. Recommended to leave set to `on` even if not archiving WAL. Allows future enabling of archiving without database restart. https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-ARCHIVE-MODE 

`archive_command` = Local shell command that is executed to archive completed WAL files. Any command that returns a `true` state tells Postgres that it ran successfully and allows the primary database instance to clean up its own WAL stream as needed. This command failing will cause the primary to keep all WAL generated since that fail. If not using archiving, or if it needs to be temporarily disabled, just set to `/bin/true`. https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-ARCHIVE-COMMAND

`archive_timeout` - `archive_command` is usually only run on completed WAL files. To limit how old unarchived data can be, this setting can be used to force archiving to switch to a new WAL file, triggering the `archive_command` for the previous partial one. This is useful for low-write databases to ensure frequent durable storage of the WAL stream. All WAL files still use the same size despite early archiving, so do not set to happen to frequently to avoid bloating WAL storage. Recommend a default value of 60 (1 minute). https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-ARCHIVE-TIMEOUT 

`max_wal_senders` - Specifies the maximum number of concurrent connections from standby servers or streaming base backup clients. More recent versions of PG default to 10. It is recommended to always have this setting be at least 2 higher than your number of replicas to allow pg_basebackup to run effectively if needed. https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-MAX-WAL-SENDERS

`wal_keep_segments` - Specifies the minimum number of past log file segments kept in the pg_wal directory, in case a standby server needs to fetch them for streaming replication. Recommend a default value of 30 to start with whenever there is at least one replica. https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-WAL-KEEP-SEGMENTS 

`max_replication_slots` - Replication slots are covered in better detail in the `Replication` part of this training than can be summarized here. Default value of 10 is fine in most cases. https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-MAX-REPLICATION-SLOTS

`checkpoint_timeout` - Maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints. Checkpoints are points in the sequence of transactions at which it is guaranteed that the heap and index data files have been updated with all information written before that checkpoint. At checkpoint time, all dirty data pages are flushed to disk and a special checkpoint record is written to the log file. Depending on write rate, this setting may need to be adjusted to allow a smoother distribution of IO when checkpointing occurs. For more information about checkpointing see https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-configuration.html

`checkpoint_completion_target` - Specifies the target of checkpoint completion, as a fraction of total time between checkpoints. Recommend setting value to `0.9`. This will cause the checkpointing process to try to spread its IO out over 90% of the time designated by `checkpoint_timeout`. So a timeout setting of 10 minutes will cause the checkpointing process to try and use up to 9 minutes to complete its flushing process vs trying to complete all those writes as fast as possible. https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-CHECKPOINT-COMPLETION-TARGET

`max_wal_size` - Maximum size to let the total WAL storage to grow to between automatic WAL checkpoints. Hitting this value will force a checkpoint. WAL storage is allowed to grow beyond this size if necessary, but once write traffic goes down, it will reduce itself to this size or lower after the next checkpoint. Defaults to 1GB. https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-MAX-WAL-SIZE

`min_wal_size` - As long as WAL disk usage stays below this setting, old WAL files are always recycled for future use at a checkpoint, rather than removed. Recycling WAL files vs recreating them as needed can greatly reduce IO requirements during the typical database load. Defaults to 80MB. https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-MIN-WAL-SIZE
