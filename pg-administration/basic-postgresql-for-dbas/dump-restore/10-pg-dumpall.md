There are two commands used to perform data dumps in PostgreSQL. The pg_hba.conf file has been configured in this environment to allow all the commands that are run to connect without requiring a password. For your own environment, you'll have to use whichever credentials allow you to connect and read the necessary information. 

The first, `pg_dumpall`, is very simplistic and only does plaintext dumps of the entire instance.

This is often not the most useful form of a dump since both the dump and the restore of the database are all or nothing and is entirely single-threaded. What it is useful for is dumping out data that is only cluster-wide, such as roles and tablespaces. In fact, this is the only way to dump out such data. The location of our dump output will be the home directory of our `training` user.

```
pg_dumpall -g -f /home/training/globals.sql
```{{execute T1}}
The `-g` option tells pg_dumpall to dump out only the cluster-wide data. In the case of this scenario, this will just be the roles. Run the following command the see the contents of this dump

```
cat /home/training/globals.sql
```{{execute T1}}

Often a superuser role is required for this tool, especially when extracting global data.

We'll be restoring this in a secondary database in a later step. Next let's look at the command that is recommended to be used when dumping out actual databases.
