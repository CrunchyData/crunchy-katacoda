With the packages installed, the first thing we need to do is to initialize the PostgreSQL cluster. CentOS does not do this for you automatically, but does provide a script (`/usr/pgsql-##/bin/postgresql-##-setup`) to set up the default instance for you that will be managed by systemd.

To run the script, execute the following statement:
```
sudo PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS="--data-checksums" /usr/pgsql-12/bin/postgresql-12-setup initdb
```{{execute T1}}

Passing the `initdb` command to the script tells it to initialize the PostgreSQL cluster. We also pass an option to the initdb command in order to enable checksums on our cluster. This is a feature that was introduced in PG 9.3 and is highly recommended to enable on all new clusters. Checksums on data pages help to detect corruption by the I/O system that would otherwise be silent. It can currently only be set on database initialization but work is underway to allow enabling it on existing database clusters. https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-initdb.html#APP-INITDB-DATA-CHECKSUMS

Next we enable the service via systemd
```
sudo systemctl enable postgresql-12
```{{execute T1}}

And now we start the database via systemd
```
sudo systemctl start postgresql-12
```{{execute T1}}

After starting a service it's always good to check its status
```
systemctl status postgresql-12
```{{execute T1}}

If you encounter any issues, you can check the syslog for any errors related to systemd starting the service (`/var/log/messages`) or check the PostgreSQL logs as well (`/var/lib/pgsql/##/data/log`) where ## is the major version of PostgreSQL, e.g. 11, 10, 96, etc).

Note that prior to PG10, the log directory was called `pg_log`.
