# Final Notes 

This scenario hopefully gave a good introduction to logical replication in PostgresQL. Note that there is also an extension called `pglogical` that may have some more advanced features that don't yet exist in PostgreSQL itself. It can also allow logical replication via the WAL stream in versions earlier than 10 as well. Just note that it is maintained by a third-party and not part of core.
