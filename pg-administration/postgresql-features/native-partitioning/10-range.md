PostgreSQL supports several types of native partitioning: Range, List, & Hash. 

Range partitioning works by splitting the data on 1 or more columns based on blocks of data with bound limits, typically time or integer series.

Log into postgres using the psql client. A `training` role and database has already been created to allow easy login.
```
psql
```{{execute T1}}
First a parent table for the partition set must be created. Already existing tables cannot currently be converted directly into partitioned tables. This table will be partitioned by time on the `logtime` column.
```
CREATE TABLE measurement (
    city_id         bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    logtime         timestamptz not null,
    peaktemp        int,
    unitsales       int
) PARTITION BY RANGE (logtime);    
```{{execute T1}}
How the partitioning is split is entirely controlled by the constraints set on its children, not from the parent. This means the range can be the same for each child or different, as long as there is no overlap. Currently all child tables must be created manually as there is no automated table creation. Naming is also completely arbitrary, but it helps to give the tables names that make sense for their content.
```
CREATE TABLE measurement_20060201   PARTITION OF measurement
   (PRIMARY KEY (city_id)) FOR VALUES FROM ('2006-02-01') TO ('2006-02-02');

CREATE TABLE measurement_20060202 PARTITION OF measurement
   (PRIMARY KEY (city_id)) FOR VALUES FROM ('2006-02-02') TO ('2006-02-03');
```{{execute T1}}
The range is inclusive of the starting value and exclusive of the ending value. If you'd like to account for data that doesn't match any existing children, PostgreSQL 11 introduced the feature of a `DEFAULT` partition.
```
CREATE TABLE measurement_default PARTITION OF measurement DEFAULT;
```{{execute T1}}
Data going into the default partition should be monitored since large amounts being there can be detrimental to performance. The `DEFAULT` feature is supported on all native partitioning types.

Use the `\d+` command in psql to see the structure of a partitioned tableset
```
\d+ measurement
```{{execute T1}}

```
\d+ measurement_20060201
```{{execute T1}}

```
\d+ measurement_default
```{{execute T1}}
Note that the constraint for the default partition is basically the opposite of all other existing constraints in the set.
