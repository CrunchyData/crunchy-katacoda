# Quick Introduction to PostGIS
This class will give you a quick introduction to some of the ways you can use [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/), the spatial extension
for PostgreSQL. The database has already been started and the spatial data has been loaded for you.

We loaded some data for U.S. Counties - a sub-state (province) geographic subdivision. 
We chose U.S. data because so much of it is freely available and released under a permissive license. 

All the data and SQL used in the following pieces are found in /data/crunchy_demo_data in your vm.

The two tables you will be working with contain data for county boundaries and the point location of storm events. 

Here are the details on the database we are connecting to:
1. Username: groot
1. Password: password (same password for the postgres user as well)
1. A database named: workshop

We will _not_ be going in depth on PostGIS we are just going to cover enough to get whet your appetite.
