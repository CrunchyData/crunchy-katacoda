# Final Notes 

All the 
[data from the](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-demo-data/releases/tag/v0.4) workshop was intentionally chosen 
from public domain or permissive licenses so that you can use it for commercial and non-commercial purposes. Feel free 
to download it and play some more at your own pace on your own machine.
  
I hope you enjoyed learning a little about PostGIS and some new analysis.
  
And with that, we are finished.
