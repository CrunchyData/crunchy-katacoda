Spatial databases are powerful because they not only store geometry, they also have the ability to compare relationships between geometries.

Questions like “Which are the closest bike racks to a park?” or “Where are the intersections of subway lines and streets?” can only be answered by comparing geometries representing the bike racks, streets, and subway lines.

The OGC standard defines the following set of methods to compare geometries.

* **ST_Contains(geometry A, geometry B)**: Returns true if and only if no points of B lie in the exterior of A, and at least one point of the interior of B lies in the interior of A.

* **ST_Crosses(geometry A, geometry B)**: Returns TRUE if the supplied geometries have some, but not all, interior points in common.

* **ST_Disjoint(geometry A , geometry B)**: Returns TRUE if the Geometries do not “spatially intersect” - if they do not share any space together.

* **ST_Distance(geometry A, geometry B)**: Returns the 2-dimensional cartesian minimum distance (based on spatial ref) between two geometries in projected units.

* **ST_DWithin(geometry A, geometry B, radius)**: Returns true if the geometries are within the specified distance (radius) of one another.

* **ST_Equals(geometry A, geometry B)**: Returns true if the given geometries represent the same geometry. Directionality is ignored.

* **ST_Intersects(geometry A, geometry B)**: Returns TRUE if the Geometries/Geography “spatially intersect” - (share any portion of space) and FALSE if they don’t (they are Disjoint).

* **ST_Overlaps(geometry A, geometry B)**: Returns TRUE if the Geometries share space, are of the same dimension, but are not completely contained by each other.

* **ST_Touches(geometry A, geometry B)**: Returns TRUE if the geometries have at least one point in common, but their interiors do not intersect.

* **ST_Within(geometry A , geometry B)**: Returns true if the geometry A is completely inside geometry B
