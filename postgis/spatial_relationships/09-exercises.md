Here are some more queries using the NYC dataset tables:

* `nyc_census_blocks`
  * blkid, popn_total, boroname, geom
* `nyc_streets`
  * name, type, geom
* `nyc_subway_stations`
  * name, geom
* `nyc_neighborhoods`
  * name, boroname, geom

**What is the geometry value for the street named ‘Atlantic Commons’?**

```
SELECT ST_AsText(geom)
  FROM nyc_streets
  WHERE name = 'Atlantic Commons';
```{{execute}}

```
MULTILINESTRING((586781.701577724 4504202.15314339,586863.51964484 4504215.9881701))
```

**What neighborhood and borough is Atlantic Commons in?**

```
SELECT name, boroname
FROM nyc_neighborhoods
WHERE ST_Intersects(
  geom,
  ST_GeomFromText('LINESTRING(586782 4504202,586864 4504216)', 26918)

> “Hey, why did you change from a ‘MULTILINESTRING’ to a ‘LINESTRING’?” Spatially they describe the same shape, so going from a single-item multi-geometry to a singleton saves a few keystrokes.
>
> More importantly, we also rounded the coordinates to make them easier to read, which does actually change results: we couldn’t use the ST_Touches() predicate to find out which roads join Atlantic Commons, because the coordinates are not exactly the same anymore.

**What streets does Atlantic Commons join with?**

```
