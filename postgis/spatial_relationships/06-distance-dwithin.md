A common GIS question is "find all the stuff within distance
X of this other stuff".

The **ST_Distance(geometry A, geometry B)** function calculates the *shortest*
distance between two geometries and returns it as a floating point number. This is
useful for reporting the actual distance between objects.

```
SELECT ST_Distance(
  ST_GeometryFromText('POINT(0 5)'),
  ST_GeometryFromText('LINESTRING(-2 2, 2 2)'));
```{{execute}}

```
    3
```
> NOTE: The distance value returned is in the units of the spatial reference
system of the input geometries

ST_DWithin
----------

For testing whether two objects are within a given distance of one another,
the **ST_DWithin** function provides an index-accelerated true/false test.
This is useful for questions like "how many trees are within a 500 meter
buffer of the road?". You don't have to calculate an actual buffer, you
just have to test the distance relationship.

Using the Broad Street subway station again, we can find the streets
nearby (within 10 meters of) the subway stop:

```
SELECT name
FROM nyc_streets
WHERE ST_DWithin(
        geom,
        ST_GeomFromText('POINT(583571 4506714)',26918),
        10
      );
```{{execute}}

```
    name
--------------
Wall St
Broad St
Nassau St
```

And we can verify the answer on a map. The Broad St station is actually
at the intersection of Wall, Broad and Nassau Streets.
