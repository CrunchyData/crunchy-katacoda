We put together this exercise to give you a taste of how easily and quickly you can add pg_featureserv to your existing PostGIS implementation and easily expose your spatial data via an API. We also showed you an example of adding a user-defined function and accessing it through the pg_featureserv generated API.

From here you can now add these features as layers to your web maps. Common implementations use [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) or [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/). You can also add functions that do more complex geospatial analysis in the database and then expose them as web features. We encourage you to check out our [PostGIS exercises](https://learn.crunchydata.com/postgis) for further information on the different types of analysis and functions you can create.

Don't forget to also check out the [official pg_featureserv documentation](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/pg_featureserv/latest/).
