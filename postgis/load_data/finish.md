Congrats! We've covered a lot in this lesson. We've seen multiple ways 
to import spatial data on the command line, and hopefully you now have a good 
idea how to use one method over another for a particular scenario. 

If you're interested in reviewing different methods for loading (non-spatial) data into 
Postgres in general, feel free to check out [this course](https://learn.crunchydata.com/postgresql-devel/courses/basics/import).

We also started a discussion on projections, but the [next course](https://learn.crunchydata.com/postgis/projection/)
 in this series contains even more technical details and examples. Enjoy!
