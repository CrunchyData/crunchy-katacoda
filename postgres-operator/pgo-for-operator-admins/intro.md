## PostgreSQL Operator for Admins

This scenario is going to give you an introduction to PostgreSQL Operator administration within a Kubernetes environment - focused on the administration of the PostgreSQL Operator itself, rather than the creation or administration of PostgreSQL instances or clusters within Kubernetes by using the PostgreSQL Operator. 

With the PostgreSQL Operator for Kubernetes installed in your Kubernetes environment, PostgreSQL Operator admins have the ability to perform a number of administrative actions related to the maintainance of the PostgreSQL Operator, as well as to perform troubleshooting of the PostgreSQL Operator if necessary. . 

The PostgreSQL Operator provides a command line tool, ```pgo```, that is used to interact with the PostgreSQL Operator and will be the basis of this scenario.  While the full `pgo` client reference will tell you everything you need to know about how to use `pgo`, it may be helpful to see several examples on how to conduct "day-in-the-life" tasks for administrating 
the PostgreSQL Operator.

The PostgreSQL Operator by Crunchy Data extends Kubernetes to give users the ability to easily  create, configure and manage PostgreSQL clusters at scale.  When combined with the Crunchy Data's PostgreSQL Containers, the PostgreSQL Operator provides an open source software solution for PostgreSQL scaling, high-availability, disaster recovery, monitoring, and more.  All of this capability comes with the repeatability and automation that comes from Operators on Kubernetes.
