# Final Notes 

We have made some data available for [playing with at](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-demo-data/releases/tag/v0.4). This data was intentionally chosen 
from public domain or permissive licenses so that you can use it for commercial and non-commercial purposes. Feel free 
to download it and play some more at your own pace on your own machine.
  
Now you have a quick and easy way to spin up PostgreSQL without installing binaries, compiling software, or any other 
administrative tasks. And, if your whole team uses the same images to start their containers, you will all be running PostgreSQL
the exact same way, making it easier to share knowledge.
