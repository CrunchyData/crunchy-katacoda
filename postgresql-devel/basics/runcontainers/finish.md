# Final Notes 

The container used in this class is available [in Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/crunchydata/crunchy-postgres-appdev). 
As long as you have Docker on your machine you can use the same version of PostgreSQL as the workshop. There is also data for [playing with at](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-demo-data/releases/tag/v0.4) workshop was intentionally chosen 
from public domain or permissive licenses so that you can use it for commercial and non-commercial purposes. Feel free 
to download it and play some more at your own pace on your own machine.
  
Now you have a quick and easy way to spin up PostgreSQL without installing binaries, compiling software, or any other 
administrative tasks. And, if your whole team uses the same images to start their containers, you will all be running PostgreSQL
the exact same way, making it easier to share knowledge.
