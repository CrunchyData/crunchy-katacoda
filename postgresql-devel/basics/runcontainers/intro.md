# Using PostgreSQL In Containers

This class is going to give you a quick introduction into running a PostgreSQL container geared towards the needs of application 
developers. You probably know of containers by the name Docker, but they are actually a technology that has been around for 
a while. 

The goal of this class is to teach a little about containers, introduce you to the containers produced by CrunchyData, and
show you how to use the container speficially built to make the lives of application developers easier.

Enjoy!
