# Final Notes 

I hope you feel more comfortable beginning to use PgAdmin4 to interact with your PostgreSQL database. If you 
are uncomfortable with the command line or perhaps you are debugging some complicated SQL, PgAdmin4 can really
be your friend. 

We really just showed a limited amount of the functionality in the GUI. As you probably noticed there is a lot 
you can do when right click on objects or click on the alternative tabs for an object. I **STRONGLY** recommend
that you keep playing around. 

The container used in this class is available 
[in Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/crunchydata/crunchy-postgres-appdev). 
As long as you have Docker on your machine you can use the same version of PostgreSQL as the workshop. All the 
[data from the](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-demo-data/releases/tag/v0.4) workshop was intentionally chosen 
from public domain or permissive licenses so that you can use it for commercial and non-commercial purposes. Feel free 
to download it and play some more at your own pace on your own machine.
  
And with that, we are finished.
