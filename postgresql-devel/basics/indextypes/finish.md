# Final Notes 

And with that we are done talking digging in a little deeper on the top useful indexes in PostgreSQL. If you want to dive deeper on each index here are the links to each index type we covered today:

* [B-Tree](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/btree.html)
* [GIN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/gin.html)
* [GiST](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/gist.html)
* [BRIN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/brin.html)

Remember, there is always a tradeoff with using an index. Be sure to look at disk size, improvements in query time, and insert/update/delete timings when working with indexes.
