Indexes are extremely handy, but they don't come completely free. Part of 
maintaining a database is putting in the time and effort to determine when 
it's appropriate to create an index, and when it might actually be more 
detrimental. 

The official docs have more helpful information on how indexes work:

- Reference for [CREATE INDEX](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createindex.html)
- [Multicolumn Indexes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-multicolumn.html)

And if you're interested, the official docs also dive deeper into [index usage](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-examine.html)
 which we had mentioned on the previous page.

The next scenario will go into a bit more detail on the **different types** of 
indexes in PostgreSQL. See you there!
