Indexes aren't always created for single columns only - Postgres also supports 
multicolumn indexes. These can be useful if you know that you'll be querying 
a lot on multiple columns at once. 

For example, in this database, we know that 
we'll frequently want to retrieve storm event details based on the state and month.
Let's use EXPLAIN ANALYZE again to see how the query planner works this out:

```
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM se_details 
WHERE state = 'FLORIDA' and month_name = 'August';
```{{execute}}

Now we'll add a multicolumn index for the combination of state and month_text. 
The syntax is the same - we just need to include both columns inside the 
parentheses like so:

```
CREATE INDEX idx_state_month ON se_details(state,month_name);
```{{execute}}

And let's run that EXPLAIN query one more time:

```
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM se_details 
WHERE state = 'FLORIDA' and month_name = 'August';
```{{execute}}


### List database indexes

Recall from the [Intro to psql](https://learn.crunchydata.com/postgresql-devel/courses/basics/intropsql)
 scenario that the `\d` command displays information on database objects. We 
 can use this to view all indexes for a given table:

`\d se_details`{{execute}}

Additionally you can also use the following psql command to see table and index
 sizes on disk:

`\dit+`{{execute}}

(`di+` will display information on indexes only.)

Index information is stored in the `pg_indexes` view, which can also be queried
 on, for example: 

```
SELECT tablename, indexname, indexdef
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'groot';
```{{execute}}
