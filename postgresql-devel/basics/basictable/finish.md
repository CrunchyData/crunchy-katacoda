# Final Notes

We hope you feel more comfortable beginning to create tables in a PostgreSQL database. We have only covered the basics, so please feel free to refer to the official [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html), which has a lot more examples and explanation. 

Let's summarize what we did:

- Used `CREATE TABLE` with basic data types like char, varchar, date, timestamp, serial, and identity
- Used constraints such as Not Null, Primary Key, Foreign Key, and Check
- Inserted data to understand how data types and constraints work

The container used in this class is available in [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/crunchydata/crunchy-postgres-appdev). As long as you have Docker on your machine you can use the same version of PostgreSQL as the workshop. Feel free to download the image and play some more at your own pace on your own machine.

And with that, we are finished. We wish you Happy Learning!
