# Final Notes

We hope you feel more comfortable beginning to create tables in a PostgreSQL database. We have only covered the basics, so please feel free to refer to the official [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html), which has a lot more examples and explanation. 

Let's summarize what we did:

- Used `CREATE TABLE` with basic data types like char, varchar, date, timestamp, serial, and identity
- Used constraints such as Not Null, Primary Key, Foreign Key, and Check
- Inserted data to understand how data types and constraints work

And with that, we are finished. We wish you Happy Learning!
