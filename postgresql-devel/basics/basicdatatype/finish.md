## Conclusion

In this course, we dove a little bit into some of Postgres' more basic built-in
 data types: character, numeric, boolean, and date/time.

It's important to have planned out your database stucture first before 
creating new tables and adding data to them. This can save you time and effort 
further down the line.

### Documentation

Here are the links to the official PostgreSQL docs, which contain more details 
about the implementation of the different data types:
