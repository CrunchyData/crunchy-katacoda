This is a continuation of the preceding course, _Intro to Data Types_. We've 
looked at a few basic data types, learned some of the nuances of numeric, 
character, date/time and boolean types, and started considering the 
implications of database schema choices. If you haven't yet, or feel you could 
use a refresher, head over to [Intro to Data Types](../intropsql/) before 
proceeding with this course.

We'll be tackling a few more data types that are used in PostgreSQL:
1. Arrays
2. Range types
3. Enumerated types
4. XML

We've grouped these more "advanced" types together in this course because it 
helps to have started with a good foundation of the data types covered in the 
previous course. 

We'll log you in to a `workshop` database using the following credentials:

* username: `groot`
* password: `password`

While we'll also introduce some related functions and operators, we won't be 
going in depth since this course is only meant to get your feet wet with these 
data types. At the end of the course, we'll mention a few other types that 
might be of interest, as well as some further resources you can look at if you 
want to continue learning.
