# Using JSON(B) in PostgreSQL

This class gives you a quick introduction to using JSON(B) in PostgreSQL. The database has already been started and natural events JSON data (such a wildfire and storms) from EONET (https://eonet.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/) was imported into the database.  

Here are the details on the database we are connecting to:
1. Username: groot
1. Password: password (same password for the postgres user as well)
1. A database named: workshop

We will _not_ be going in depth on JSON in PostgreSQL. We are just going to cover enough to whet your appetite.
