# Final Notes 

The container used in this class is available [in Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/crunchydata/crunchy-postgres-appdev). 
As long as you have Docker on your machine you can use the same version of PostgreSQL as the workshop. All the 
[data from the](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-demo-data/releases/tag/v0.4) workshop was intentionally chosen 
from public domain or permissive licenses so that you can use it for commercial and non-commercial purposes. Feel free 
to download it and play some more at your own pace on your own machine.
  
I hope you enjoyed learning a little about using [JSON in PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/datatype-json.html) and can bring that into your work. 
  
And with that, we are finished.
