# Using PostgreSQL Full Text Search

This class is to quickly get you hands on with using some of the features in PostgreSQL Full Text Search.
The database has already been started and historical storm event data from the U.S. has already been loaded.   

Here are the details on the database we are connecting to:
1. Username: groot
1. Password: password (same password for the postgres user as well)
1. A database named: workshop

We will _not_ be going in depth on Full Text search in PostgreSQL. We are just going to cover enough to whet your appetite.
The idea is you should read and play more with Full Text Search after completing this exercise.
