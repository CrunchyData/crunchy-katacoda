# Final Notes 

The container used in this class is available [in Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/crunchydata/crunchy-postgres-appdev). 
As long as you have Docker on your machine you can use the same version of PostgreSQL as the workshop. Feel free 
to download it and play some more at your own pace on your own machine.
  
The only way to truly learn this technology is to play/experiment/use it for a while. You have all the tools you need - do it!
  
And with that, we are finished.
