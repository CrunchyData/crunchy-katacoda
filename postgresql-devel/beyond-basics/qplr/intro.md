This class gives you a quick introduction to using the R statistical language as an embedded langauge in PostgreSQL. The database has already been started and R has been installed into the learning environment as well. 

While it is not required, it would probably be helpful to do the class on [functions in PostgreSQL](https://learn.crunchydata.com/basic-postgresql-devel/basicfunctions) before doing this class. 

Here are the details on the database we are connecting to:
1. Username: groot
1. Password: password (same password for the postgres user as well)
1. A database named: workshop

We will _not_ be going in depth on R or R in PostgreSQL. We are just going to cover enough to whet your appetite.
