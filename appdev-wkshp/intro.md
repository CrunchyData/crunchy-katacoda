# Using PostgreSQL Cool Features in Application Development

This workshop is to get you hands on with using some of the features in PostgreSQL you may not know about. The idea is that these features will make it easier to get your job done.

## Class Structure
The outline of this workshop is:
1. Run PostgreSQL in containers
1. Load SQL for table definitions and then load some data into the tables
1. Work with spatial data
1. Work with full text search
1. Work with key-value columns
1. Work with JSON data
1. Use R embedded in PostgreSQL to do statistical functions 


The overall goal is to have you feel comfortable using these features and exploring them more when you are finished. It is also to help you understand the PostgreSQL is the 80% in the 80/20 rule - you can use it for at least 80% of your application development needs. You can feel comfortable reaching for PostgreSQL as your favorite development datastore.  

We will _not_ be going in depth on each of these topics. Just enough to get you started.
