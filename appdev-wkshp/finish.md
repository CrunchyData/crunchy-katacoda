# Final Notes 

The container used in this class is available [in Dockerhub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/thesteve0/repository/docker/thesteve0/postgres-appdev). 
As long as you have Docker on your machine you can use the same version of PostgreSQL as the workshop. All the 
[data from the](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-demo-data/releases/tag/v0.1) workshop was intentionally chosen 
from public domain or permissive licenses so that you can use it for commercial and non-commercial purposes. Feel free 
to download it and play some more at your own pace on your own machine.
  
The only way to truly learn this technology is to play/experiment/use it for a while. You have all the tools you need - do it!
  
And with that, we are finished.
