This class gives you a basic introduction to using [PGAdmin4](https://www.pgadmin.org/) - a GUI for working with your PostgreSQL database.

From the project site:

> pgAdmin is the leading Open Source management tool for Postgres, the world’s most advanced Open Source database. pgAdmin 4 is designed to meet the needs of both novice and experienced Postgres users alike, providing a powerful graphical interface that simplifies the creation, maintenance and use of database objects.

In this scenario we will just get you started using the tool. We will cover topics such as :
1. Connecting to a database
1. Navigating in the interface
1. Creating, editing, and executing some SQL
1. Creating a table

We have already have spun up a PostgreSQL instance with a database. Inside that database we have created a spatially enabled table for storm event locations in the United States.

Here are the details on the **database** we are connecting to:
1. Username: groot
1. Password: password (same password for the postgres user as well)
1. A database named: workshop

The credentials for **PgAdmin4** are:
1. username: admin
2. password: password
